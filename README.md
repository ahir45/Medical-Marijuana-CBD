# Medical-Marijuana-CBD
Medical Marijuana &amp; CBD
Cell 1 (Code):
This cell imports necessary libraries such as Numpy and Pandas. It seems to be set up in a Kaggle environment, given the comments about the kaggle/python Docker image and the directory structure.

Cell 2 (Code):
This cell imports the dataset "CanabisBenefits.csv" and displays the first few rows of the DataFrame. However, the results are not displayed in our overview, so I can't comment on the data directly.

Cell 3 (Markdown):
The cell provides an overview of the dataset columns. The dataset contains information about different health conditions, evidence scores for the efficacy of cannabis or CBD in treating those conditions, popular interest, number of citations on Google Scholar, and various other details.

Cell 4 (Code):
This cell renames the evidence score column and checks the unique values in the "evidence_score" column. The results are not displayed in our overview.

Cell 5 (Code):
This cell creates a count plot to visualize the distribution of the "evidence_score" column. Again, the visual output is not visible in our overview.

Cell 6 (Markdown):
The cell provides an interpretation of the previous plot, discussing the distribution of the evidence_score across the dataset. It points out that most health conditions have limited or no evidence supporting the efficacy of cannabis or CBD.

Cell 7 (Code):
This cell creates a count plot visualizing the distribution of different health condition categories. While the actual visual output is not visible in our overview, it is meant to show the number of health conditions within categories like mental health, neurological, pain, cancer-related, and gastrointestinal.

Cell 8 (Markdown):
The cell interprets the previous plot, indicating that the most common health condition categories in the dataset are mental health, neurological, and pain.

Cell 9 (Code):
This cell creates a box plot to visualize the distribution of the evidence_score across different health condition categories. It intends to show variations in evidence scores across categories like mental health, neurological, pain, and others.

Cell 10 (Markdown):
The cell provides a detailed interpretation of the box plot from the previous cell. It discusses the median evidence scores for different health condition categories and the variability within these categories. For example, it points out that while the cancer-related category might show some promise, the evidence varies greatly.

Comments:
Good Practices Observed:
Effective use of visualizations to understand the distribution of data and relationships between variables.
Detailed interpretations provided in markdown cells after visualizations enhance understanding and clarity.
The notebook is well-structured, with a clear flow of data exploration and analysis.
Improvement Suggestions:
Consider adding additional visualizations, such as histograms, to understand the distributions of continuous variables.
For categorical variables with many unique values, consider using horizontal bar plots to make category names more readable.
It's essential to test for missing values and handle them appropriately, either by imputation or deletion, especially before visualizing or modeling.
When interpreting box plots, consider discussing outliers if they are present. This can provide insights into potential anomalies or unique cases within the dataset.
Let's continue our review by examining more cells.

Let's continue with our review:

Cell 11 (Code):
This cell creates a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between popular interest and evidence_score. The intention is to understand if there's any correlation between public interest and the strength of evidence supporting cannabis or CBD for various health conditions.

Cell 12 (Markdown):
The cell provides a detailed interpretation of the scatter plot. The main observation is that there's no clear correlation between popular interest and evidence score. It's pointed out that there are many conditions with high popular interest but low evidence scores.

Cell 13 (Code):
This cell creates a count plot to visualize the distribution of conditions where CBD is involved in treatment.

Cell 14 (Markdown):
The cell interprets the previous count plot, pointing out that the majority of conditions in the dataset do not involve CBD in treatment, while a smaller number of conditions do involve CBD.

Cell 15 (Code):
This cell filters the dataframe to showcase conditions with strong evidence (evidence_score >= 5). The intention is to list out health conditions with strong scientific support for the efficacy of cannabis or CBD.

Comments:
Good Practices Observed:
Effective use of scatter plots to visualize relationships between two continuous variables.
The notebook maintains a consistent pattern of visualizing data and then interpreting the visualizations in markdown, which is commendable.
Improvement Suggestions:
For scatter plots, consider adding a regression line or a trend line to better visualize any potential linear relationship between the variables.
It might be interesting to provide a breakdown of the conditions with strong evidence. For instance, which categories do they belong to? This could be visualized using a bar plot or a pie chart.
For binary or categorical variables (like the CBD column), consider providing percentages along with counts in visualizations or interpretations. This can offer a more comprehensive perspective on the distribution.
When showcasing conditions with strong evidence, consider sorting them based on evidence score or another relevant metric for better presentation.'
